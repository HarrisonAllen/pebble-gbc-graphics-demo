# pebble-gbc-graphics-demo

This is a demo project utilizing the pebble-gbc-graphics package, I've dumped all of the code I've used to make this project here. For some quick links:

## Core Pebble Files

* [Pebble GBC Graphics Library](https://github.com/HarrisonAllen/pebble-gbc-graphics)
  * A more updated version of the library I wrote and used to display the graphics on the Pebble 
  * Check this link out for a tutorial on how to use the library!

* [Pebblemon watchapp](https://github.com/HarrisonAllen/pebble-gbc-graphics-demo/tree/master/pebblemon)
  * This is a project used to demonstrate the graphics library, while also being a full game

* [Pebblemon .pbw file](https://github.com/HarrisonAllen/pebble-gbc-graphics-demo/blob/master/pebblemon/pebblemon.pbw?raw=true)
  * Need to sideload it? Download here

## Helper scripts
* [Python conversion script](https://github.com/HarrisonAllen/pebble-gbc-graphics-demo/blob/master/resources/PokemonConverter.py)
  * This is what I used to convert route maps, tilesheets, dialogue data
  * Takes some preprocessing, but you're welcome to try and use it

* [Pokemon Sprite compression script](https://github.com/HarrisonAllen/pebble-gbc-graphics-demo/blob/master/resources/SourceImages/Pokemon/PokemonSprites/PokemonBattleSpriteConverter.py)
  * The process for this is quite complex, but if you want to reverse engineer it then it's here
